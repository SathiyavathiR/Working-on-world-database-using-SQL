# Working on world database using SQL
World Database Project üåç
Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è
This project utilizes the World Database, which includes tables for countries, languages, and cities, to demonstrate various Data Query Language (DQL) commands and SQL operations. The World Database is implemented using MySQL, a popular relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its ease of use and scalability.

Features üöÄ
DQL Commands: Demonstrates various DQL commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to retrieve and manipulate data from the country, language, and city tables.
SQL Operators: Illustrates the use of SQL operators like WHERE, ORDER BY, DISTINCT, and LIMIT to filter and sort data.
SQL Clauses: Explores SQL clauses such as GROUP BY and HAVING to perform aggregate functions and filter grouped data.
SQL Joins: Showcases different types of SQL joins including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN to combine data from the country, language, and city tables.
Usage üõ†Ô∏è
Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/SathiyavathiR/Working-on-world-database-using-SQL.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd Working-on-world-database-using-SQL
Ensure you have MySQL installed and running on your system.
Execute the provided SQL scripts (Worlddbqueries.sql) using your preferred MySQL client or command-line interface. These scripts will create the necessary tables and populate them with sample data from
the World Database.
Alternatively, explore the Jupyter Notebooks to interact with the data and execute DQL commands and SQL operations on the country, language, and city tables.
Dependencies üõí
MySQL or another compatible relational database management system (RDBMS): Users need to have MySQL installed and configured on their systems to execute the provided SQL scripts against the country, language, and city tables.
Python (optional for executing Jupyter Notebooks): Python may be required if users choose to explore and execute the provided Jupyter Notebooks for interacting with the data and running queries.
